Winters is different in the US â€” no snow, and it's surprisingly warm, around 20 degrees Celsius on December 13th. I'm not used to such winters because it is completely different in Europe.
I'm keeping my plans simple. I really like being outside, so I will probably spend time with my friends outdoors. We might go to parks, take hikes, or just enjoy the sunny weather.
I'm also thinking about going to Florida for a few weeks. I am still not sure about this one but the idea is great by itself.I'm not big on elaborate plans, but I want to make the most of this unique winter experience. Whether I'm hanging out with friends or exploring a new place, I just want to enjoy the simple pleasures of winter break.
