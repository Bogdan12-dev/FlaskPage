In this story by Amy Tan, she talks about falling in love when she was fourteen and a Christmas dinner that made her think a lot about who she is. Amy worries that her crush, Robert, won't like her Chinese family and their food. The dinner is a bit uncomfortable because of the cultural differences, but Amy's mom teaches her to be proud of being Chinese. The story shows how it's hard to fit in sometimes, but also important to be yourself and not feel ashamed of where you come from.

It's up to each person whether they want to show their culture after moving to a new country. Some might share their traditions to celebrate diversity, while others might prefer fitting into the new culture. It's a personal choice, and both ways can be okay. The important thing is respecting each other's choices and embracing diversity.



The main idea of the story is about feeling caught between two cultures, and the important lesson is to be proud of who you are, even if you're different. Amy Tan's mom teaches her this lesson during the Christmas dinner. Her mom says, "You want to be the same as American girls on the outside. But inside, you must always be Chinese. You must be proud you are different. Your only shame is to have shame." This shows that the story is about understanding and accepting your unique background and not feeling ashamed of it.


Some people think it's good to be proud of being different because it makes everyone unique and brings diversity. Being proud of our differences can help us understand and respect each other. However, others might believe it's better to focus on what we have in common to avoid division. It really depends on what each person values and their experiences.


The author's main goal is to share a personal story and teach a lesson about being proud of your cultural background. It's more about sharing an experience than trying to inform, persuade, or just entertain. But, every such story is entertaining story
